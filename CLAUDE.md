# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Furo is a Data and API Marketplace DApp that allows developers and data providers to monetize their APIs and data streams using crypto micropayments (x402). The platform enables providers to publish endpoints and set pricing, enforce pay-per-call access through x402 paywalls, verify on-chain payments, and manage settlements and payouts. It also provides a marketplace for discovery, ratings, and analytics. The MVP will be a centrally hosted app (Next.js and Node) with blockchain-native payments.

### A Note on Showcasing Skills
To better demonstrate core software engineering skills and reduce reliance on external SDKs, this project focuses on building key components from scratch, including a custom backend API and implementing the core x402 payment protocol manually.

## Modules Overview

1. **Marketplace Core (Custom Backend API)** – Custom-built backend using Node.js, Express.js, and Prisma to manage PostgreSQL database
2. **Custom x402 Payment Gateway** – From-scratch implementation of the L402 protocol
3. **Provider Sandbox and SDK** – Plug-and-play middleware and SDK tools for providers
4. **Frontend (Marketplace UI)** – API discovery, payments, onboarding, and dashboards
5. **Billing and Settlement Engine** – Records payments and manages payout flows
6. **Reputation, Dispute, and Governance** – Ratings, reviews, and dispute management
7. **Search, Indexing, and Analytics** – Fast API discovery and usage analytics
8. **Storage and Docs** – API documentation, schemas, and metadata storage
9. **Security and Rate Limiting** – API protection and replay prevention
10. **RAG AI pipeline** – Semantic search using AI for API discovery

```

### Key Features
- **Homepage (`/`)** - API marketplace with search, filtering, and API cards
- **API Detail Pages (`/api/[id]`)** - Individual API showcase with documentation and "Pay & Call" functionality
- **Provider Dashboard (`/dashboard`)** - Analytics, earnings, and API management
- **API Listing Form (`/list-api`)** - Provider onboarding with pricing configuration

### Web3 Configuration
- Uses RainbowKit for wallet connectivity
- Supports multiple chains: Mainnet, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, Sepolia
- Project ID configuration required: `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID`
- Most Web3 components loaded with `ssr: false`

## Mock Data

Currently uses mock APIs including:
- Weather Data API
- Crypto Price Feed
- AI Text Generator
- Image Recognition API

Located in `lib/mock-data.ts`.

## Configuration Notes

- **Tailwind CSS v4.0** with custom color palette and CSS variables
- **TypeScript strict mode** enabled
- **Path aliases:** `@/*` maps to root directory
- **Dark mode:** Uses class strategy (`dark:` prefixes)
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first approach

## Development Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm package manager
- Environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID` for RainbowKit
- Web3 wallet (MetaMask, RainbowKit-supported wallets) for testing
